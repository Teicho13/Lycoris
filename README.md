# C++ Engine Selfstudy project

This is a little self study project where I want to explore the ECS concept as well as NOESIS GUI.
There are two included projects - one called _Core_, and one called _App_. [Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) is used to generate project files.

Core builds into a static library and is meant to contain common code intended for use in multiple applications. App builds into an executable and links the Core static library, as well as provides an include path to Core's code.

The `Scripts/` directory contains build scripts for Windows and Linux, and the `Vendor/` directory contains Premake binaries (currently version `5.0-beta2`).

## Getting Started
1. Download this repository.
2. Open the `Scripts/` directory and run the appropriate `Setup` script to generate projects files. You can edit the setup scripts to change the type of project that is generated - out of the box they are set to Visual Studio 2022 for Windows and gmake2 for Linux.
